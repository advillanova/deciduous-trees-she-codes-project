      <p>
        Are you also enchanted by the magic of color changing trees in the fall?
        These magical color changing trees are called deciduous, which means:
        "falling off at maturity", just like our baby teeth, for instance. The
        color changing process, on the other hand, is caused by the ability of
        trees, as well as other plants and beings, to perceive the weather and
        sunlight adjustment, and so, changing their leaf color and, finally,
        falling.

          üå≥ Green: Chlorophyll is essential for plants to produce energy. When
          the sunlight starts to fade, they produce less of it.
